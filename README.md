# Welcome!
"MSU" stands for "Minecraft Server Utilities". It is a collection of Minecraft server utility plugins.<br>
These plugins are written by MCUmbrella and have a variable update cycle and update direction.<br>
Almost all of these plugins are used on MCUmbrella's own servers, which means that they are well-tested. Of course you can use them on your own servers as well!<br>
